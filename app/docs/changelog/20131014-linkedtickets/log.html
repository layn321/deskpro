<h1>Linked Tickets</h1>

<p>
	From the ticket view in the Agent Interface, agents can now create linked tickets from the Actions menu or the gear
	menu on specific messages.
</p>

<p>
	Creating a linked ticket will open the standard new ticket form with all ticket properties pre-filled
	with the properties from the original ticket.
<p>
<p>
	Once the ticket is created, both tickets will contain links back to each other making it easy to navigate
	between linked tickets.
