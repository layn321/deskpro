<h1>Improved Snippets</h1>

<p>
	The snippets feature in DeskPRO has been improved for tickets and chats.
</p>

<h3>Shortcut Codes</h3>

<p>
	You can now add <i>shortcut codes</i> to snippets. When you type a shortcut code into the replybox,
	the full snippet is automatically expanded. Use shortcut codes to quickly insert common snippets
	without having to open the snippets manager.
</p>

<h3>Better Navigation</h3>

<p>
	The snippets manager now includes an "All Snippets" section which shows you all of your defined snippets in a single
	list. This makes the newly-added filtering feature very useful. Just type a few characters of the snippet title
	you are looking for, and the list is filtered down in real-time. You can also use the up and down keys on your
	keyboard to select a snippet in your list. Once highlighted, just press the enter key to insert it into your reply.
